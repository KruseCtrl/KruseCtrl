# Hi, I’m @KruseCtrl

## Recently?

I've been doing bash and ruby, I've been working a lot on automation of launching a cloud computing cluster. It launches from a ruby tty-prompt interface, running through several bash scripts and is connected to ARM templates, Heat templates and cloud formation templates to launch on openstack, aws or azure.


## Learning
I’m currently learning Ruby and Bash.
